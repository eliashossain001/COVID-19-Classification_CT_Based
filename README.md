# Classifying COVID-19 from CT Scan images  using InceptionV3 Deep Learning 

The aim of semantically segmenting CT scan images of COVID-19 patients is important since it would not only aid in disease detection, but also in quantifying the seriousness of the illness and, as a consequence, in prioritizing community care. We suggest computer-based approaches for detecting contaminated tissue in lung CT scans that have been shown to be effective. The availability of such a system in today's pandemic will assist in the automation, prioritization, speeding up, and broadening of COVID-19 medical care worldwide.
